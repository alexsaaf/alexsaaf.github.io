title: ...But I can't draw!

When learning to develop games with the Unity game engine, I encountered a bit of a problem. In order to get more practice, I wanted to start a game project to work on. All I needed was an idea for a game, so I attempted some brainstorming, which, at first, worked well. However, I soon noticed that I kept throwing away a lot of ideas based on the same reason. I simply couldn't see myself managing to make the art needed for the ideas I was coming up with. Many would suggest that I should team up with an artist, but being new to Unity, I didn't yet have the confidence to work along with others. I had to find another solution.

## The solution?
I soon realized that I would have to find assets online, but finding assets which fit together turned out to be a lot more difficult than I thought. In fact, I was just about to give up my search when I found something interesting. A complete asset pack to build a game from:

The pack in question was the [Super Platformer asset](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/42013). It has all the assets needed to build a small platformer. The pack even had a video showing a small prototype. I decided to set up a challenge for myself; To reproduce the prototype on my own.

Said and done, I soon had a platformer game coming along. It's not the most feature-rich game, but it did give me something to work on and really test my skills with unity. It also spawned a couple of ideas for both future additions to the game and new games. That's all for today, keep an eye out for the next post!
